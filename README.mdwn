# Amygdala

Computer asisted brain stem.

This is meant to be a simpler replacement to [my lizard
brain](https://github.com/frioux/Lizard-Brain), both because the world has
improved and so have I.

The old system's design was around allowing arbitrary inputs and outputs; the
new system is only decoupled as I see fit, instead of enforcing that arbitrarily
from the start.  It seems likely that this will end up deployed to and depending
on AWS, in which case the code will include terraform to manage it.
